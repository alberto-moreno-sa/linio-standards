Linio Twig Coding Standard
-------------------------

This guide links to [Twig's Coding Standard](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/coding_standards.html).
Linio does not maintain it's own Twig standards.
Instead, we choose to utilize the standard that was created alongside with the language.

The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code
from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and
expectations about how to format Twig code.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
